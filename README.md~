# VLSI_Project


For the code string_extractor.py which is responsible for assigning optimized 2d placement for an input boolean expression in a 17x17 grid:

	1.We require NLTK library, which was used to tokenize the input expression
	2.Code can be tested by uncommenting the code written at the bottom for various types of possible boolean expressions
	3.This code can be fed in with input from Sudipto's code whose result is an optimized nand2 expression
	4.Number of iterations can be changed to get better results
